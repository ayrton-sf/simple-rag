FAQ001,Company Policy,"Our company is committed to transparency, fairness, and compliance with all state and federal housing regulations. We follow equal opportunity housing principles and do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, gender, or income source. All listings are verified before publication, and every agent is licensed under their respective state board. Clients are encouraged to review their contracts thoroughly, ask for clarification at any stage, and report any irregularities to our compliance team at compliance@realestateco.com."
FAQ002,Property Buying Guide,"To buy a property, start by browsing available listings on our platform or by contacting one of our local agents. Once you find a property you like, schedule a viewing to ensure it meets your needs. After that, you can submit an offer through your agent. When an offer is accepted, a purchase agreement is signed, followed by inspection, appraisal, and loan finalization. Buyers are advised to secure mortgage pre-approval before making offers to speed up closing. Our agents can also guide you through title transfer, escrow deposits, and final closing paperwork."
FAQ003,How to Rent a Property,"If you’re interested in renting, explore our rental listings by area, price range, or property type. When you find a suitable home, complete a rental application online, providing proof of income, references, and identification. Once approved, you’ll be required to sign a lease agreement and pay the first month’s rent plus a security deposit. Some properties may also require renter’s insurance. Tenants can renew leases through their account dashboard, and maintenance requests can be submitted directly through our online tenant portal or by calling our support line."
FAQ004,How to Schedule a Viewing,"To schedule a property viewing, click the 'Book a Visit' button on the listing page or contact the agent directly by phone or email. Most agents are available Monday through Saturday between 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM. For virtual tours, some properties offer 3D walkthroughs or live video sessions with an agent. It’s recommended to book viewings at least 24 hours in advance. If you need to cancel or reschedule, notify the agent promptly to avoid conflicts with other scheduled visits."
FAQ005,Financing and Mortgage Options,"We partner with several national and local lenders to offer competitive mortgage and financing options. Buyers can choose from fixed-rate, variable-rate, FHA, and VA loans, depending on eligibility. Pre-approval is strongly advised before making an offer to strengthen your negotiation position. Our agents can introduce you to verified loan officers who will assess your credit, income, and budget. Additionally, we provide resources for first-time homebuyer programs, down-payment assistance, and cost calculators to help you estimate monthly payments before applying."
